ðŸš€ Built a Real-Time Character Counter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Tech Stack: HTML | CSS | JavaScript

As a hands-on mini-project to strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals, I created a dynamic character counter tool for a text area input. The application updates in real-time as the user types, displaying both the number of characters typed and the number remaining out of a set limit (e.g., 200 characters).

Key Features:

âœ… Live character tracking using JavaScript's input event listener

âœ… Real-time counter displaying "X/200 characters"

âœ… Input is restricted after the maximum limit is reached

âœ… Warning message is shown when the character limit is exceeded

âœ… Clean and responsive UI styled with CSS

ðŸ’¡ This project helped me enhance my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and user input validationâ€”all critical components for creating interactive front-end experiences.
